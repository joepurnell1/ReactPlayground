# Artists Search Web App - Playground

This project is intented to be a simple messaround app to try new libraries, syntax, and anything else. [A web clone of this React Native app](https://github.com/joepurnell1/ReactNativePlayground).

Plain and simple Reactjs using bit of state and using the fetch api for data. Feel free to use this as a springboard for any experimentation you want to do.

## Data

This uses the Spotify API for getting artist data, you will need a bearer token and add it as the value in `ArtistsService.js`. You can get the token from here [Spotify Docs](https://developer.spotify.com/console/get-search-item/?q=tania%20bowra&type=artist&market=&limit=&offset=) here you can click 'Get Token' and use the returned token. I'll probably find a sexier way to do this.

## Prerequisits

Just make sure you run `npm i` and you should be good to go.

## Included Commands

Out the box:

`npm start`

`npm build`

`npm test`

`npm eject`

## That's all

I simply intend to use this as a basline for messing with new things. Feel free to do the same :)
